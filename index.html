    <p>
      Croissant is a small crescent-shaped puff pastry, traditional for French
      and Austrian cuisine, with or without filling.
      <br />
      The origin of croissants is surrounded by a huge number of myths. There is
      a version according to which baking in the shape of a crescent moon has
      been traditional for Austria since the year 1000. In France, croissants
      are first mentioned in the description of the so-called royal banquet in
      Paris, held in 1549. According to another version, croissants were
      officially introduced and popularized in France by Marie Antoinette of
      Austria in 1770, and they were first made by Viennese bakers in 1689.
      <br />
      It is believed that the first recipe for croissants was published in 1891.
      The recipe for these puff pastry products was first mentioned in France in
      1905. At first, croissants were made from a different dough, and they
      looked like butter buns.
      <br />
      Bread in the shape of a crescent moon was popular in the Middle Ages in
      the East (there are even versions that such bread in the shape of a
      crescent moon - a symbol of Islam - was invented by Muslims). In French
      cuisine and even culture in general, the croissant is a kind of national
      symbol.
      <br />
      In France, it is traditional to eat croissants for breakfast together with
      a cup of coffee or cocoa. In addition, croissants are usually included in
      the breakfast menus of most hotels in the world (the so-called European
      continental breakfast), designed to receive visitors from Europe.
