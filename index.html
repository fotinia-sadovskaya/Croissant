    <p>
      Croissant is a small crescent-shaped puff pastry, traditional for French
      and Austrian cuisine, with or without filling.
      <br />
      The origin of croissants is
      surrounded by a huge number of myths. There is a version according to
      which baking in the shape of a crescent moon has been traditional for
      Austria since the year 1000. In France, croissants are first mentioned in
      the description of the so-called royal banquet in Paris, held in 1549.
      According to another version, croissants were officially introduced and
      popularized in France by Marie Antoinette of Austria in 1770, and they
      were first made by Viennese bakers in 1689. It is believed that the first
      recipe for croissants was published in 1891. The recipe for these puff
      pastry products was first mentioned in France in 1905. At first,
      croissants were made from a different dough, and they looked like butter
      buns.
